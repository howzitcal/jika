# About for {name}


Ubuntu is home to many humans throughout the world, it is their distribution of choice. I have called it home on and off for over 15 years, seen unity come and go, witnessed the mess that is snap packages, etc. Ubuntu has grown to be the Linux distribution of choice when moving from platforms like Windows or MacOS, however the out of the box experience (OOBE) is lacking certain polish. The great news is the DE is GNOME, and we have all the tools needed to fix this.


{name} aims to take a clean install of Ubuntu and remove certain slow packages, add support for other package managers and heavily customize the desktop environment and user experience while ensuring a high level of attention is being paid to all details.


{name} is opinionated, there are choices that are made for the end user, these choices have been made to ensure that the best user experience is being met at all times. The aim is not to be like Windows or MacOS, but to rather be the most effective, efficient and powerful DX layered on top of GNOME.


{name} does allow the end user to add/remove functionality based on the args provided to the script, see [README.md](https://github.com/howzitcal/jika/blob/main/README.md).


Happy computing.
